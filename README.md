# This is assignment5 for **The School of AI**
- Here, you will find three files named as
    - model.py: It has the Model definition
    - utils.py: It has common utility functions definitions
    - S5.ipybn: Main notebook where the utility functions and Model is imported and the network is trained

<br>

## utils.py: has the following functions
- GetCorrectPredCount: compute accuracy
- train_step: perform one training epoch
- test_step: perform one test epoch for validation
- plot_acc_loss: plotiing the statistics


<br>

## Model.py: 
- Has the network architecture definitions for classification task having CNN network as backbone with couple of MLP layers for classification towards the end <br>

<br>

## S5.ipynb:
- Main file where other utility functions are called and network is trained and validated
<br>
